## Technology Stack

The following technologies are used in the Airbnb Clone Project. Each tool plays a specific role in achieving functionality, performance, and scalability.

### Django
A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend of the application. It handles routing, request handling, ORM-based database access, authentication, and overall server-side logic.

### Django REST Framework (DRF)
An extension of Django used to build RESTful APIs. It simplifies serialization, authentication, and API views, making it easier to create and manage API endpoints.

### PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source relational database used to store structured data such as user profiles, listings, reservations, reviews, and payments. It is known for its reliability and support for advanced querying.

### Celery
A task queue used for handling asynchronous operations such as sending emails, processing payments, and running background tasks.

### Redis
Used as a message broker for Celery and also for caching purposes. Redis improves performance by storing frequently accessed data in-memory.

### Docker
A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies into isolated environments. It ensures consistency across development, testing, and production.

### Nginx
A high-performance web server and reverse proxy used to serve static files and forward requests to the Django application running on a WSGI server.

### Gunicorn
A Python WSGI HTTP server used to run the Django application in production. It handles incoming requests and communicates with Django to return responses.

### Git & GitHub
Version control and collaboration tools. Git tracks code changes, while GitHub hosts the repository and enables team collaboration through branches and pull requests.
