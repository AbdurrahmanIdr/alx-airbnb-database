## Database Design

### Users

- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `name`: Full name  
- `email`: Unique email address  
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password  
- `is_host`: Boolean flag for host role  

**Relationships:**  
A user can own many properties, make multiple bookings, and write reviews.

### Properties

- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `owner_id`: References Users  
- `title`: Name of property  
- `location`: City or address  
- `price_per_night`: Cost per night  

**Relationships:**  
A property belongs to one user (host) and can have many bookings and reviews.

### Bookings

- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `user_id`: References Users  
- `property_id`: References Properties  
- `check_in`: Start date  
- `check_out`: End date  

**Relationships:**  
A booking is linked to one user and one property and has one payment.

### Reviews

- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `user_id`: References Users  
- `property_id`: References Properties  
- `rating`: Numerical score  
- `comment`: Text review  

**Relationships:**  
A review belongs to one user and one property.

### Payments

- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `booking_id`: References Bookings  
- `amount`: Total cost  
- `status`: Payment status  
- `payment_method`: e.g., card, PayPal  

**Relationships:**  
Each payment is associated with one booking.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management

Handles user registration, login, and profile updates. Includes role-based access control to distinguish between guests and hosts.

### Property Management

Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Guests can browse available properties.

### Booking System

Allows guests to make and manage bookings, ensuring availability is accurately tracked.

### Payment Processing

Integrates secure payment functionality to complete bookings. Tracks transaction history and statuses.

### Reviews and Ratings

Guests can leave feedback and scores for hosts, improving platform trust and transparency.

### Search and Filtering

Allows users to find listings using filters like price, location, and availability.

### Admin Panel (Optional)

Enables admin users to manage users, properties, bookings, and flag violations.

## API Security

### Authentication

Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) ensures only verified users can access protected resources.

### Authorization

Role-based access restricts actions like listing properties or modifying data to authorized users only.

### Data Encryption

Sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest, safeguarding user credentials and payment data.

### Rate Limiting

Limits request frequency to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.

### Input Validation

All user inputs are sanitized to defend against SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

### Secure Payments

Payments are processed using third-party gateways that comply with security standards like PCI-DSS.
