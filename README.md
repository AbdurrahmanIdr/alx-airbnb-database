## Technology Stack

### Django

A high-level Python web framework used for building and managing the backend of the application, including business logic, APIs, and authentication.

### Django REST Framework (DRF)

An extension of Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs, providing serialization, view handling, and token-based authentication.

### MySQL

A robust and scalable relational database system used to store application data like users, listings, bookings, and transactions.

### GraphQL

A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, enabling flexible and efficient communication between frontend and backend.

### Celery

A distributed task queue used for handling asynchronous tasks like email notifications and background jobs.

### Redis

Used as a broker for Celery tasks and also as a caching layer to improve performance and data retrieval times.

### Docker

Provides containerization to standardize and isolate development environments, ensuring consistency across systems.

### Git & GitHub

Version control and repository hosting tools used to manage source code, track changes, and enable collaboration across teams.

### GitHub Actions

Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows via CI/CD pipelines.
