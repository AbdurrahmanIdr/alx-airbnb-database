## Technology Stack

### Django

A high-level Python web framework used for building and managing the backend of the application, including business logic, APIs, and authentication.

### Django REST Framework (DRF)

An extension of Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs, providing serialization, view handling, and token-based authentication.

### MySQL

A robust and scalable relational database system used to store application data like users, listings, bookings, and transactions.

### GraphQL

A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, enabling flexible and efficient communication between frontend and backend.

### Celery

A distributed task queue used for handling asynchronous tasks like email notifications and background jobs.

### Redis

Used as a broker for Celery tasks and also as a caching layer to improve performance and data retrieval times.

### Docker

Provides containerization to standardize and isolate development environments, ensuring consistency across systems.

### Git & GitHub

Version control and repository hosting tools used to manage source code, track changes, and enable collaboration across teams.

### GitHub Actions

Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows via CI/CD pipelines.

### Nginx

A production-grade web server and reverse proxy used to serve static assets and route requests to backend services.

### Gunicorn

A Python WSGI server used to run the Django app in production, handling incoming HTTP requests.

## Database Design

The database for the Airbnb Clone Project is designed to reflect real-world booking platform relationships. Below are the key entities, their important fields, and how they relate to one another.

### 1. Users

Represents people using the platform, including hosts and guests.

**Key Fields:**

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: Email address (unique)
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password
- `is_host`: Boolean to indicate if the user can list properties

**Relationships:**

- A user can own multiple properties (if they are a host)
- A user can make multiple bookings
- A user can write multiple reviews

---

### 2. Properties

Represents a home or apartment listed by a host.

**Key Fields:**

## Feature Breakdown

Below is an overview of the main features implemented in the Airbnb Clone Project. Each feature contributes to the platform's overall functionality, user experience, and business logic.

### User Management

Handles user registration, login, authentication, and profile management. It distinguishes between guests and hosts and secures user data through hashed passwords and token-based authentication.

### Property Management

Allows hosts to list, update, and delete properties. Each property includes information such as title, description, location, images, and pricing, enabling users to browse available accommodations.

### Booking System

Enables guests to book available properties for specific dates. It manages availability, prevents double-bookings, and tracks reservation status throughout the check-in and check-out process.

### Payment Processing

Integrates a secure payment system that handles transactions for bookings. It ensures each payment is linked to a booking and supports tracking of payment status and methods.

### Reviews and Ratings

Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay. This feedback system enhances trust and transparency between guests and hosts.

### Search and Filtering

Provides users with the ability to search for properties based on criteria such as location, date, price, and amenities. This improves user experience by narrowing results to relevant listings.

### Admin Panel (Optional)

Offers administrative functionality to manage users, properties, and bookings. Useful for moderation, platform maintenance, and resolving disputes.

## API Security

Security is a fundamental aspect of the Airbnb Clone Project, especially as it handles sensitive user data, financial transactions, and account activities. The following key security measures will be implemented:

### Authentication

We use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to ensure only verified users can access protected endpoints. Authentication is essential for protecting user sessions and preventing unauthorized access to personal data.

### Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced to differentiate permissions between guests, hosts, and admins. This prevents users from accessing or modifying resources they do not own (e.g., a guest editing a hostâ€™s property listing).

### Data Encryption

All sensitive data, including passwords and payment details, will be encrypted both in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest (using hashing and encryption algorithms). This protects against data breaches and unauthorized data exposure.

### Rate Limiting & Throttling

APIs will be protected against abuse through rate limiting and throttling. This prevents brute-force attacks, reduces server load, and helps mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) threats.

### Input Validation & Sanitization

All user input will be validated and sanitized to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This ensures application integrity and protects against malicious data payloads.

### Secure Payment Processing

Integration with secure third-party payment gateways will ensure financial transactions are handled in a PCI-DSS compliant manner. This protects users from fraud and financial data theft.

### Error Handling & Logging

Sensitive system errors will not be exposed to clients. Instead, secure logging will be implemented to monitor suspicious activities while maintaining system transparency for developers and administrators.
